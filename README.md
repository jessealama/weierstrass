# weierstrass

Weierstrass is a basket for data analytic work.

The repository is named in honor of the mathematician Karl Weierstrass.  Weierstrass was [one of the main figures][weierstrass-wikipedia] in the 19th century “rigorization” of mathematical analysis.  This movement in mathematics was a self-reflective period that helped to clarify this part of mathematics considerably.  Pretty much all of the basic definitions that we use today in calculus and related mathematical subjects were laid down at this time.

I imagine that it took a lot of intellectual courage to do mathematics at this time.  The problems being worked on—foundational questions about real numbers—were obviously mathematical, but they also clearly a touch of philosophy in them, too.  As someone with a [background][phd] in mathematics and philosophy, I find that this period speaks to my own intellectual style and I admire the work done in those times.

The repo is not a particular concrete product.  It is, rather, a bundle of useful scripts and tools that I find useful in my own work.  I’ve licensed it under the [Unlicense][unlicense].  They are offered in the hope that you'll find them useful, too.  May we all be so bold as scientists such as Weierstrass and find something new through rigor (which, for me, is just another word for taking ourselves seriously).
